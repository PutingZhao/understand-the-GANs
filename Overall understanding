1.Generative Net's input is random noise obeying some distribution and output is some type of images or somethings needed to translate such 
such as a sentence(we can view the process of GN as the inverse process of common classifies or CNN).
2.The noise obeying some type of distribution is mapped to some domain one by one.So the domain represent the distribution of the intended 
things that we want to generate.
3.The output of GN is a probability of a single image belonging to positive sample,namely, a true sample.
4.The final outcome of GANs is a balance that no matter what type of the image,the output of DN is 0.5 which means the GN can't discriminate
whether the image is false and the result comes from random guesses.
5.Given the label, they predict the associated features----Naive Bayes
  Given a hdidden representation, they predict the associated feature----GANs/VAE
  Given some of the features, they predict the others----inpainting
  (---------input------feature------label)
